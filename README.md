# TOD_simulation
Simulation of teleoperated driving in shipping processes
This projects provides a tool to simulate requests for teleoperators (coming from shippers and freight forwarders) 
It provides KPIs (e.g., average wait time, average queue length, makespan, delay, etc.) based on scenatio setting.
Tour data is from the MaasGT tool. 
Scenarios can be defined by varying the number of available teleoperators, teleoperator takeover time, sample size (from MaasGT data), etc.
The main is simulate.py
